January::Eight Chinese nationals were quarantined at a hotel in  Johor Bahru  on 24 January after coming into contact with an  infected person  in neighbouring  Singapore .  Despite early reports of them testing negative for the virus,  three of them were confirmed to be infected on 25 January and subsequently quarantined at the  Sungai Buloh Hospital  in Selangor.  The  Malaysian health ministry  published guidelines on the virus and established designated hospitals in each of  Malaysia's states  to manage any positive cases.  The Malaysian public were reminded by local authorities to take precautionary measures in the wake of the virus threat with those travelling to China have been advised to stay away from animal farms and markets in the country and to not eat raw or semi-cooked meats.  Following several earlier suspected cases in  Sabah 's capital of  Kota Kinabalu , all direct flights between the state with China were stopped indefinitely. On 24 January, a two-year-old child who was suspected to have been infected was detained along with their parents. The parents refused quarantine and were detained the next day by police at  Senai International Airport  before returning to China.  The patient including others who refused quarantine were subsequently placed under close monitoring by the local Health Ministry.  On 26 January, a fourth case of the virus, unconnected to previous cases, was detected.  A suspected case was also detected in the state of  Kedah 's  island of Langkawi  involving two female Chinese nationals with both victims quarantined at the Sultanah Maliha Hospital; one later confirmed positive on 29 January.  With the increasing number of cases reported in neighbouring  Thailand , both the state of Kedah and  Penang  tightened their borders by conducting stringent checks at its international entry points.  A Chinese female national in  Bintulu  of  Sarawak  also suspected of having contracted the virus led to the state tightening its border and postponing direct flights to  Hainan , despite a recently signed  memorandum of understanding  (MoU) establishing direct flights with Sarawak. Of the total of 25 Chinese nationals in Sabah earlier suspected of having contracted the virus, most of them tested negative as of 28 January although one of them later tested positive for the virus upon reaching China.  Another eight suspected cases were recorded in Sarawak on 29 January; five in  Kuching  and one each in  Sibu ,  Bintulu  and  Miri .  Of the total eight suspected cases in the state, six have tested negative.  Within the same day, three additional positive cases were confirmed in  West Malaysia , involving a four-year-old child quarantined at the Sultanah Maliha Hospital in  Kedah , a 52-year-old man at  Sultanah Aminah Hospital  in Johor and a woman at  Sungai Buloh Hospital  in Selangor.  An eighth case was reported at the Permai Hospital in Johor on the next day. 

February::On 4 February, Malaysia reported two new cases, including a 41-year-old local male, which was the first case involving a Malaysian.

In addition, the total number of recoveries reached two. On 9 February, one new case was reported, bringing the total number of cases to 17.  One recovery was reported, bringing the total number of recoveries to three. On 10 February, the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee prohibited entry by Singaporeans due to a major increase of positive cases in the neighbouring country.  That same day, the total number of cases rose to 18. The latest case was a Malaysian citizen who had recently traveled to China. On 13 February, one new case was reported, bringing the total number to 13. The new case was a 39-year old woman from China. On 15 February, three new cases were reported, bringing the total number to 22. Four new recoveries were reported, bringing the total number of recoveries to seven.  That same day, an elderly American woman, who was among hundreds of passengers who disembarked from the  MS Westerdam  cruise ship in  Cambodia  and flew to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, was identified as Malaysia's 22nd confirmed case.  Meanwhile, the remaining 143 passengers, including a further six passengers from the same flight with the woman, had been declared free from the virus and were allowed to return into their respective countries. On 16 February, one recovery was reported, bringing the total number of recoveries to eight.  That same day, the  Holland America Line  and  Cambodian health ministry  requested that Malaysian health authorities re-test the US citizen to ensure the accuracy of its findings.  The American woman tested positive for COVID-19 during the second test.  Following this second test confirmation, the Malaysian authorities announced that the remaining passengers of the  MS Westerdam  would not be allowed to enter the country despite several flights being chartered by Holland America Line with  Malaysia Airlines . The cruise liner's passengers had not been able to depart from Cambodia since the country did not have any direct flights to Europe and the United States.  During a third check-up, the American woman tested negative for COVID-19.  In response, the Cambodian government questioned the accuracy of the Malaysian authorities' testing of the American woman, while claiming there were no diplomatic tensions between Cambodia and Malaysia over the testing of the American woman.  On 22 February, the Malaysian Health Ministry issued a statement that the America female patient was recovering after 72 hours of treatment.

Two remained in hospital.  That same day, a female Malaysian hospital worker in Sabah's  Kudat District  suspected of having contracted the virus was quarantined when she developed symptoms after returning from  South Korea .  Although she was later declared free from the virus,  the Malaysian government imposed a ban on travelers from South Korea in response to the  rise in positive cases  within that country. On 27 February, one new case was reported, bringing the total number to 23.  Two new recoveries were reported, bringing the total number of recoveries to 22. On 28 February, two new cases were reported, bringing the total number to 25.

In March 2020, several countries in  Southeast Asia  recorded a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases as a result of a  Tablighi Jamaat  religious gathering held at  Masjid Jamek  Sri Petaling , Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, which was suspected to have infected many participants with the virus.  The event, which was held from February 27 to March 1, 2020, was attended by about 12,500 participants, including about 1,500 participants from outside Malaysia.  Following the surge of COVID-19 infection cases in Malaysia stemming from the  Kuala Lumpur religious gathering , the  Ministry of Health  announced that Malaysia was in the late containment stage and that a special meeting would be held to discuss the next course of action. We have a slim chance to break the chain of COVID-19 infections. Help the  Ministry of Health  (MOH) by playing your part, as every individual is responsible taking every step to protect of their family. I appeal to all Malaysians to take this movement control order seriously. Stay home and do not go out. Failure is not an option here. If we continue to maintain a  so what  attitude, we may face a third wave of this virus greater than a tsunami.  Director-General of Health  Noor Hisham Abdullah 's Facebook address to Malaysians following a rise in the number of positive cases in the country, 18 March 2020. On 16 March, Prime Minister  Muhyiddin Yassin  announced that the federal government would be imposing a nationwide lockdown known as the  Movement Control Order  (MCO), which would come into effect on 18 March and last for two weeks.

On 19 March, Health Director-General  Noor Hisham  once again urged people to stay home, saying that Malaysia has a small chance of blocking the rapid spread of coronavirus disease as compared to the  current situation  facing by Italy; stating that if it misses the third wave of infection, the situation will be out of control similar to what happened in Italy. He also indicated that the Government would extend the  movement restriction order  for another 14 days.  The Prime Minister also appealed to all Malaysians to adhere to the movement control in order to prevent further infections within the country. On 20 March, it was reported that 15 medical personnel had contracted COVID-19, with one being placed in an  intensive care unit  (ICU).

On April 2 and 3, there was a drastic increase in daily cases in the country to above 200 cases a day.  Thus, on 3 April, Director-General Noor Hisham stated the sudden spike in new cases were not the 'third wave', but largely due to active case detections on areas affected by  Enhanced Movement Controlled Order , a stricter version of the MCO.  On 5 April, the Director-General notified that a new cluster had been identified, which involved a person with a travel history to Italy, and now had grown as far as the third generation, with 37 positive cases and five fatalities as of the day.  On 6 April two more clusters had been identified: a church gathering at  Kuching  which resulted in 83 cases and two fatalities and a wedding at  Bandar Baru Bangi  which led to 88 cases. Both clusters infected people across five generations.  On 8 April, the number of cases breached the 4,000 mark with a new subcluster identified in  Rembau  which was linked to the religious event in Kuala Lumpur and infected 27 people across three generations. On 10 April, the government extended the movement control order until 28 April. By 11 April, a total of 224 healthcare workers had become infected which through investigation were found to be caused by patients with SARI symptoms, patients whose conditions were unknown before getting treatment and from on the ground screening and other activities.  The death on 13 April was of a 62-year-old man who had attended the Kuala Lumpur tabligh jamaat gathering.  On 14 April, the Director-General mentioned a detection of a new cluster in Sendayan, Negeri Sembilan involving a  madrasa  with at least 39 cases, and 28 virus clusters were detected nationwide so far. 15 April was the first date that Malaysia recorded fewer than 100 new cases since 14 March.  On 18 April a new cluster had been identified among healthcare workers in three government hospitals in Sabah with 31 cases.  On 19 April new cluster had been identified which consisted of 43 students returning from Temboro,  Magetan, Indonesia .

At the end of April 2020, daily cases in the country had shown a decline when registering double-digit daily cases. The Director General of Health noted that the decline in cases of this infection was a result of government action implementing the Movement Control Order (MCO) nationwide.
